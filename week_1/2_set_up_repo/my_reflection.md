## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Open Source and Repo

Everytime I hear the word repo I think of the movie Repo Man (the one from 1984) but I digress.  Anyway - creating a repo on Github is ridiculously easy (thank God) and using the Git app to store it locally is cool.  I was taught to use the command line and usually work backwards (I create my files first then init, create and push to Github). I love that there are many ways to do the same thing in Github and in programming. 

Open Source - honestly sounds too good to be true but I love it!!!  Coming from a corporate environment (both legal and financial) I find it both refreshing and disturbing that people are willing to share their work so freely.  I am a little confused about the licensing agreements though.  I think the only one I am familar with is the MIT license I hadn't heard of the other licenses before today.  I believe getting credit for your work is abosutely essential.  So in that regard licenses are great.  But I still confused over what exactly the license agreement allows you to do or protects you against.

I was familar with the material previously so this exercise is a welcome respite.  My github challenges are pulling requests and merge conflicts.
