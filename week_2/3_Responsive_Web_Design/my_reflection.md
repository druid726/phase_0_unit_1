# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Responsive web design in cool and a lot of fun.  The concept of taking one design and making it accessible to everyone regardless of device is very egalitarian, especially since the content doesn't change.  Smartphones and tablets have made a huge impact on the design aspects of the Internet. People using smaller, more portable devices may not have the time to leisurely browse the site and UX becomes more and more relevant the smaller the device.  

Visually impaired is an interesting concept - what exactly does that encompass?  Most people assume the term refers to the blind but there is a significant portion of the population over 40.  The age when reading glasses become necessary.  Accessibility to the Internet for the blind has been addressed with screen readers but what any one else?  Do we increase font sizes?  Change background and font colors?  Make hyperlinks and buttons big and bold?  Do these elements applied to all websites or just those geared toward an older population?  Interesting. albeit unsexy, questions.

Before reviewing this lesson, the concept of UX design, to me splitting hairs.  But now I can see its relevance for smaller devices.  I enjoyed studying design concepts and look forward to learning more.  

I found a ton of resources some helped some didn't.  Here are the ones I found the most useful:

I didn't use the initializr because I didn't feel comfortable with it.  I don't know if I did the assignment incorrectly by just making the Women in Coding responsive.
