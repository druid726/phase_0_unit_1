Blog url: druid726.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html


Actually I started a blog on Word Press to document my DBC journey.  This is very different since I know someone else will be looking at it and possibly commenting on it and I will see and interact with these people a lot during the next 4+ months.  I enjoy and prefer the anonymity of Word Press.  This exercise was a little weird I never really looked at the design of the site, just the content.  I listed the sites I did because the information was not overly nested and easily accessible.  It was interesting to find out that I do have a preference as far as the visual appeal concerned.  All three of my favorite sites had similar formats. I also learned how to post something.  I don't do it that often.  Well I wanted a new and challenging experience.
