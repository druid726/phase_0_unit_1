Reflections on Beginning HTML and CSS

I love HTML and CSS mainly because I grasped the concepts fairly quickly and deluded myself into believing that I was programming.  I now realize this is not the case.  HTML is fairly straight forward and not very complicated so I really didn't have any particularly good or bad events happen.  I do need to "solidify" what I have learned since I do forget what I don't use.  This exercise helped me remember and flesh out using columns which helped me the most. 

I use the W3schools for web colors a lot and found it very helpful.

This site is awesome for color gradients.
