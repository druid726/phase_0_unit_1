# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I believe web standards are vital to the continued growth and expansion of the WWWW.  These standards impact every facet of web design and development to ensure accessibility, compatability and ease of use on a variety of devices and across different platforms. Honestly the only reason we do this is to communicate with someone else and if cross-browser or platform or device issues are stopping our work from getting them -- well we might as well be masterbating alone in bathroom.

I like the standard structure I didn't know there was a difference between section and article - the reading was very helpful even though I still don't quite get it.  I am confused by the outlinier substituting or ignoring certain headings if they come after this or that.  Something else to work on.  But overall I found it very helpful.  It drives home the point to have a plan and not just jump in head first.  I'm a designer who tries to make content fit the design and that's not really working for me.

HTML 5 rocks - the new elements are something I don't have to think about.  Just add water -- no classes, no ids, no divs.
Woo hoo!!!!

Reset.css is necessary to remove any default settings such as margin and padding.  I prefer to use normalize.css because it makes everything naked.  I see a dramatic change in a website using normalize which I did not see with reset.

I have used IE - 8 was the last version I used and Chrome -- I love Chrome.  Yes I have seen noticeable differences in the display between the two browsers. I think its bad that they don't display the sites the same.  I think it's incredibly burdensome to a designer.

I found these two sites that were helpful:
