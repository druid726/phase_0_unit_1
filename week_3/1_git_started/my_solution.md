## Release 5: Errors you encountered
I pulled any changes down with the Git app.  I did it before I read anything stating that I wasn't supposed to, so no problems.

## Release 6: Reflection

Git and Github seem so easy to use and so far they have been.  But I have a little experience doing pulls and fetches and resets and they give me nightmares.  The problem I have is that I can't figure out where the issue occurred therefore I have no idea how to correct it.  While I am improving in my ability to visually discern what is going on when I look at the repository in Github, its still a losing battle.
I have searched on the Internet for more information but none of it has really helped.  Even the links provided in this release were unhelpful.  I think I need to have someone over my shoulder guiding me.
