# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

My biggest time management challenge so far - has been not anticipating the workload correctly.  The first week I was away Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and had to scramble at the end of the week to get everything done on time.  The second week I read through the exercises beforehand so I had a better idea of how to allocate my time.  I need to set up a system - I am not working now so I have a lot of free time - so I can do the work, set aside time for pair-sessions and have time for myself. 

The counterintuitive productivity blog spoke to me (can I get a witness!!).  I have periods of intense creativity and productivity and also periods of intense reflection and maintenance.  I find that starting small or trying to do nothing is a great way to go otherwise I become paralyzed focusing on the end result.  I usually need to walk away from a problem after a period of time (the longer I work on it the less I understand it) - that's when the potential solutions will present themselves to me. 

I plan to try meditation to combat the stress and set-up time frames for working on aspects I hate or find boring.  I have a schedule for Mon-Fri of Phase 0. I am hoping to use the weekends for catch-up and relaxing.
