Hey Gang,

Apologies if this comes out sounding crabby.  I'm just finishing this weeks work and I can't believe how much writing is involved.  I am an introvert and don't usually reflect on a lot and then having to share....definitely out of my comfort zone.

I don't really know what to say other than Hi and I am available most days and most times for pair sessions.  I have been reading a lot of the cultural blogs and I am very relieved to discover that I am not the only person who is nervous, excited, anxious and/or paralyzed with fear.  It's just good to know.

Here is my info and links:

Patti O'Neill
Newburgh, NY - upstate about an hours ride on MetroNorth
My favorite websites are IMDb, Fanfiction.net (I read a lot) and Pinterest.
My thinking style is Abstract Sequential (which sounds like an oxymoron to me) and 
My learning style is multimodal

I guess I made a mistake since my wireframe.html is located in the druid726.github.io repo under the unit1_projects folder.

I am looking forward to meeting everyone and working with you over the next coming weeks.  

Enjoy the rest of your weekend.

Patti

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.
