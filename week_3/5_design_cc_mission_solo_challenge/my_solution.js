// Refactored Code

//I think this code is fine.  I don't see where it can be Refactored.





// Reflection
// I'm not sure I did this correctly.  It seems too simplistic.  It was fun to do.
// I love everything about the CodeCombat exercises - I'm a big kid at heart.  
// Unfortunately I don't have the time to explore this further, that's one of
// the most frustrating things about Phase 0 - there are so many cool links and 
// websites to delve into but I don't have the time to explore them.
