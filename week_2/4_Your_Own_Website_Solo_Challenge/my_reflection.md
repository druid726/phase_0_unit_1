My Website url: <!-- Website URL here (remove comment) -->

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I really enjoyed this.  I don't have a great deal of experience in or knowledge of UX so this was interesting.  I don't think that I would want to delve any further into UX but I'm glad I learned a little more about it.  As stated previously, I enjoyed working on this -- I hate wireframing but understand its value. My site does not look like my wireframe at all but, for me, that's not unusual. Wireframing is a good starting point but that's all it is. I have an idea, I execute the idea, I don't like the result, look at what other people have done, incorporate aspects of those that appeal to me and repeat as necessary.  Right now I feel like my site is a little bare bones.  So I am looking forward to adding some text, maybe some links to social media sites or other websites I find interesting.  Maybe some photos.  

I finally figured out how to comment out whole sections in Sublime -- very cool.  My understanding of clear and clearfix is growing.  I feel am getting better with color schemes.  I paint and I am having a lot of difficulty with how different colors appear and interact on the web and that is very frustrating.  But I found a cool website which is below.
