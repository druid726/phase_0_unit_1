Reflections on Web Basics

I enjoyed this lesson very much because the material is familiar to me.  Although I did not realize that there is a difference between the Internet and World Wide Web or that websites and web apps are two different things.  The latter one is especially important since their differences go a long way in the early stages of a project.  Aspects such as the frequency of updating the site, if there will be user input and how any input or data will be pulled or updated will decide if you are creating a website or a web app.  As far as my web page - I am always happy when something works the first time but it's very plain.  (I'm sure it won't be for long though).  So far no big Aha moments just solidification of concepts which is more helpful for me.
