My reflections on Git and Github

I originally downloaded git and github about nine months ago on a Windows machine.  I had to downlaod it more than once to get it to work correctly.  Do I remember or understand any of the issues I encountered not really.  I do remember that I felt emboldened after each attempt and exeperienced an overwhelming since of pride and joy when it finally worked.  After my computers untimely demise last December and my migration to a Mac environment I discovered that the Mac universe is a much friendlier place to be.

I really like using Git and Github because of the version control.  The ability to save my changes into a separate version is immensely useful especially for a newbie like me.  Everything is still new to me so I make a lot of mistakes and sometimes making a change in one area has unexpected consequences in another and it is very helpful to get a previous version (without my latest changes) since I really can't undo a mistake I didn't know I made.  Github is great for that.  With Git the program is on mine machine locally so I can do anything I want to it and the version on Github remains unchanged until I save it up.  Github is similiar to a library.  I check out a book (program), read it (write code) and when done return it to the library (upload the changed file to Github).  The only real difference is Github saves the check-in as a new version while the library wouldn't save it at all just place the book back on the shelf.  To carry the library analogy a little further the new versions in Github would be similar to a new edition of a book in a library.  With Github I can go back and either check out the newest version number (edition) or go back to a previous version number (edition).

Even programmers with a lot of experience use Git and Github.  Github allows several different people to have access to the file at the same time and each programmer can add their changes to the file without overwriting the other programmers changes.  This cuts down the amount of time needed to complete or edit a program since you don't need to wait for one programmer to finish before another programmer can work on it.  As long as more than one programmer isn't working on the same aspect this is an incredibly effective use of time and resources.
