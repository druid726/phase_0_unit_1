//My Reflection

// I hated this exercise.  I felt left in the dark, there was no discussion -- it felt like we were playing telephone 
// with the Mariana Trench.  Most of the tests failed with the exception of the function tests (#1,4,7).  I did not learn
// anything new with regards to coding but I did get some experience with the JavaScript console in Chrome and Node in
// the terminal.
