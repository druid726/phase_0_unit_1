Reflections on HTML Solo Challenge

I was a little confused by the instructions.  I wasn't sure where to save it and I used dummy text.  I believe the main focus of the exercise was the implementation of the instructions and not content.  At least I hope so.  I did join the hangout last night to ask a question but the answer of just read through it and follow the instructions was not helpful.  I guess this is an example of the multimodal approach to learning I need.  Anyway I am finding myself very confused, like a mouse in a maze. The Git App is really confusing to me, I learned how to access Git and Github through the command line and using the app makes me feel like I am at square one.  I have used HTML, CSS and Git before these shouldn't be stumbling blocks for me and I am feeling frustrated.  The bright spot for me in this lesson was learning how to use the Emmet short-cuts in Sublime Text.  This exercise was the most frustrating and disappointing to me so far.  I don't feel like I learned anything just ran through a gauntlet to come out the other side.
