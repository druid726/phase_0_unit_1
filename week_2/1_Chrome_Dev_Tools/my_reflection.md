# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

The Document Object Model -- well - I think I understand it conceptually but a lot of it is confusing - nodes etc.  I do know that repeated requests to the DOM will slow down your site and that refractoring JavaScript is a good idea.  I do understand the concept of different parts of a website and viewing them a in tree-like structure (I get that) but JavaScript and looking for nodes etc - very fuzzy to me.

Chrome Web Tools are interesting - I really like that you can experiment with the HTML and CSS on the fly, I haven't tried to save it up yet.  I looked at wordpress.com and my site and wordpress seems full of JavaScript.  I am barely to the point where it doesn't look like a kaleidoscope of multi-colored text and I have a hard time knowing what text in HTML corresponds to the text on the screen.  I know I will enjoy using Dev Tools in the future but for right now its a little jumbled.

No aha moments or solidification just wading through right now.

I did check out the Treehouse blog and that was helpful.
