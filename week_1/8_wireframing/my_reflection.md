Wireframing

I like to have plan or a visual map when I'm creating something or trying to solve a problem.  This was backwards so it was different but interesting.  Wireframing the site when it has already been done did not give me any great insight other than it was harder than I thought and basically every website is just a UI. I have always known that but this just seemed to solidify it for me.  Whether it is a simple, plain website like Google or a huge marketplace like Amazon they both require user interaction so that is new way for me to look at user experience.  I never really understood the difference between UI and UX and this helped with that.  I found I prefer to sketch it out rather than using a program - I feel like the 'muscle memory' makes it more real and tangible.  Actually I think I prefer to use blocks or legos to design the layout.  I am more a big picture, overall impression wireframe person than someone who does the hi-def version, I find that tedious.  

I enjoyed the Design Thinking approach - the synthesis.  I think that's so cool and leads to options and ideas you can't imagine when you begin a project.  And that's what I like best -- the ideas fleshed out.
